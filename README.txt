Quineâ€“McCluskey Algorithm Implementation and Circuit Constructor 
============================================

Usage: 

NOTE: Must be using python3

Option 1 - run "python3 QM.py" on the command line to run the algorithm on its own fully on the command line.
				- The input must be formatted similarly to this example: m(1,2,3)+d(5,7)
				- m denotes the minterms, and d denotes the "don't cares"
				- if there are no "don't cares", then only include the minterms formatting.

Option 2 - run the GUI to use the full program functionality, which runs the algorithm and produces a schematic of the circuit.
				- Enter the minterms seperated by commas, as follows: 1,2,3
				- Similarly enter the "don't cares"
				- values can be entered as discrete values (e.g. 1,2,3), or as ranges, (e.g. 1-27), or a mix of both
					(e.g. 1,2,3,5-10,22,23).
				- finally, press the RUN button and the schematic will be generated.
